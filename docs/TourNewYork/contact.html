				<p class="basictext">
					My name is Andy and I am a third year at RIT. All my life I lived in New York City so I basically know the ins and outs of it.
					That's why I decided to make the webiste about NYC. I didn't really go travel to a lot of places when I was growing up. But my
					parents would take me around NYC and I would love every second of it! I hope that my website can help others be inspired to come
					to NYC because in my opinion this is the best city!
