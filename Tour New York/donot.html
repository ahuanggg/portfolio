            <p class="basictext"> People in NYC walk really fast and if you're a New Yoker you are used to it but if you are coming from some place else
                you need to be able to walk just as fast. New Yorkers are mean and impatient, including myself, We get mad if we are stuck behind someone who is walking too slow so 
                if you aren't a fast walker at least give people space to walk around you. Especially in Manhattan

            <p class="basictext">
                When you are in NYC you are bound to take the train so let me teach you something what I call train manners. In a normal train the seats usually hold 3 people, don't be rude and take up someone elses seat. 
                There are barely enough seats for everyone. Another rule is when boarding the train please don't block the people from getting out. Stand to the side and let them out first then you can go in.
                The train won't run off without you. Lastly never, and when I say never, I mean never make eye contact with people on the train. It's weird and uncomfortable, rather look at the floor or the advertisements, never at people.

            <p class="header2">Driving in NYC</p>

            <p class="basictext"> 
                If you do drive in NYC, I don't know why you would want to, traffic is a major problem especially in Manhattan. If you do drive I recommend you only drive in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, and Staten Island. Pretty much
                any where but Manhattan. Manhattan has way to much traffic and if you aren't from NYC you will probably crash. Another tip about driving in Queens is to becareful of two-way streets that look like one-way. They have a lot of 
                these in Queens and are very accident prone. The best way to avoid all of this is just take the subway, your really not getting to your destination faster.
