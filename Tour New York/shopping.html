                bound to spend some $$$ here!

            <p class="basictext">Macy's, Macy's, Macy's. This store is so big that it needs to have it's own section. Macy's at 34th street takes up an entire block, and goes 200 feet up! This is 
                the largest deartment store in the WHOLE United States. They have 9 stories filled with big named stores like Gucci, Burberry, Louis Vuitton, Nike, Levis, and many more! Going through all the 
                floors alone will take at least a couple of hours. I am a New Yorker and I have been to Macy's many times but yet everytime I go I still need a map, that is how big Macy's is.

                SkyView Center is a another great place to shop. However SkyView Center has a lot of more asian things since many Asians live near there. This place sells delicious asian pastery,
                offer a wide variety of Asian groceries, things you can't get at a regular super market, and also offeres the traditional mall things like Nike, Adidas, Levis, Uniqlo, and many more.
                This place just gives off such an authentic Asian vibe but with a twist.

            <p class="basictext"> 
                Saks 5th Avenue is for those who are rich, I'm talking about $$$$$$ rich. Saks 5th Avenue is mostly designer brands where a regular black t-shirt can cost up to $200 just because of the brand.
                If you are that rich then this is the place you are looking for. They have brands such as Balenciaga, Fendi, Gucci, Alexander Wang, Givenchy, the list just goes on and on. But in all seriousness Saks 5th
                Avenue is a really convienient place if you are looking to buy designer items since they offer such huge brand names all in one place.
